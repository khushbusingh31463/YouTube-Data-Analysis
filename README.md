# Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project on AWS


## Project Overview
This project develops a scalable data engineering pipeline on AWS to analyze YouTube video trends. It involves secure management, streamlined processing, and analysis of structured and semi-structured data based on video categories and trending metrics. The system leverages AWS services to efficiently handle large volumes of data.

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion:** Automated mechanisms to ingest data from various sources into AWS.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Transformation of raw data into a structured format for analysis.
- **Data Lake:** Centralized repository for storage of structured and semi-structured data.
- **Scalability:** Dynamically scales with increasing data sizes.
- **Cloud-Based Infrastructure:** Utilizes AWS for handling large-scale data processing.
- **Data Visualization:** Employs Amazon QuickSight for creating interactive dashboards and reports for analytics.

## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3:** Used for data ingestion and storage.
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Manages secure access to AWS services.
- **Amazon QuickSight:** Business intelligence tool for data visualization.
- **AWS Glue:** Serverless data integration service that simplifies ETL processes.
- **AWS Lambda:** Executes code in response to events such as changes in data or system state.
- **AWS Athena:** Provides SQL-based data analysis on Amazon Glue.

## Dataset Description
